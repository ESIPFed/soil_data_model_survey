Many of our respondents were looking at questions around global biogeochemical processes, specifically carbon cycling.

Most of the data sources were drawn from the primary scientific literature with several respondents also drawing from direct response from study PI or colleagues. 
One respondent mentioned online databases  (e.g., USGS NWIS, USGS Geochemical Landscapes, NEON). 
Notably none of the study respondents mentioned DataOne or other data repositories for data discovery.
Identified challenges included QAQC protocols, difficulty getting data upon direct request from colleagues, formatting heterogeneity, missing or badly identified metadata, template development and stability, project management for aggregation effort in large groups.
Things that worked well in the process were orchestrated hackathons.

In general many respondents want data paired with a publication and already entered into a universal template. 
There was frustration with brittle in-house harmonization pipelines that were not always backwards compatible. 
Automatic discovery from primary literature made another wishlist.
General FAIR data principles were recognized as important, though not named as such.
In general there were no differences in the harmonization pipeline process between the providers and aggregators.


Unsurprisingly open public data was well supported by the respondences with interest in broaderening scienific impact and increased visibility.
However there were several concerns voiced by data providers including:

  1) Attribution and engagement was a named concern of respondences, in particular collonial science was called out as being partiucalrlly problematic.
  2) Time investments with unclear rewards.
  3) Unclear what "data base" was appropreate for a given data set.
  4) Data permissions issues.


Data is messy and data providers wish that was better understood by data aggregators.
Both error/uncertainty and the exact methods use things that data providers feel is often overlooked by data aggregators.

## Summary of responses

The survey followed the interviews and had a total of 23 responses.
Even though the levels of experience and purposes behind compiling data products varied, there were many commonalities across all respondents. 

### Finding sources

When asked how they find their data sources, the majority of participants indicated that they used literature, while others used databases, reached out to colleagues that had worked on the topic, or even used a combination of all three.
These responses indicate that data accessibility is much less of a problem now than previously with conducting a meta-analysis.

### Painpoints and suggestions

When asked what went well with compiling the data product or what could have gone better, most people listed difficulties rather than successes.
Of the few successes, people reported comprehensive search results and the standardization of metadata and control vocabulary.
The difficulties of compiling the data product included trying to determine what authors meant when there was a lack of documentation, and the large amounts of time spent to sort data and create a template.
One respondent concluded that it was easy to automate ingestion of data from the same source, but very time consuming to mix data formats due to the need for harmonization. 

### Ideal process

The participants shared that the ideal process for data harmonization involves gap-filling, standardizing units and table structure, as well as being able to preserve the original data yet build off of it for their own purposes. 

### Main hurdles

Lastly, the main hurdles to contributing to data products and to other people using data include the time sunk into curating and formatting data products, the complex organization of data, and finding which data products to contribute to.
Overall, the difficulty of meta-analysis results from trying to harmonize such complex and diverse data sets.
