Standardization of names and units shouldn't isn't difficult, someone has to suggest a template. Units should all be SI. Gap-filling (data imputation) is an entirely different matter and requires serious, deliberate discussion over each affected data element. This applies to re-sampling techniques (genetic horizons -> depth intervals, EA splines, etc.). Table structure is important, but mostly from an organizational perspective: fully normalized schemas are elegant but can be very annoying to work with (many joins for a simple query). There is a balance that has to be found between data archival purposes (fully normalized, no duplication, coded values) ------- data analysis (usually denormalized, lots of duplication, raw values).","It already is, but I'd like these data to be more widely available.

2020-07-10T07:57:18Z,"I compile data products to look for global scale patterns in ecological or biogeochemical processes. Sometimes the objective is to answer a science question, like are above and belowground phenology in sync? Sometimes it is to come up with parameter values or inputs for models, such as root inputs to rhizosphere soil, or sorption capacity at different sites.","I have used several methods, depending on the question. One is a standardized literature search, using either google scholar or web of science. Another is pulling data from more curated databases. A third way is contacting groups that I know do a specific kind of experiment and have the data I'm looking for (a targeted approach, I guess).","When data is provided to me directly by the data provider (a collaboration with experimenters, say, modeling a specific site), I wish I had communicated better the kind of format that is useful to me, so I didn't have to do so much curation upon receiving the data. For example, sometimes experimenters are not very clear with metadata, so I have to do some extra communication to make sure I know the units, and the conditions under which some measurements were taken. Everyone has their own shorthand. Also, sometimes experimenters (my past self included) tend to use excel spreadsheets in wide format, with extra columns below or to the side of the main dataset containing averages of other columns, graphs, highlights. Which meant that I had to do a lot of cleaning in excel before I could read the data into my analysis program.","Oof, I don't know the answer to this, but I have a lot of opinions. I think if there is gap-filling (for some processes anyway) I would like to know which data are gap-filled and which are original, perhaps with another column as a flag. For units, I prefer SI units, with units clearly labeled in a metadata sheet somewhere that also includes the column name and description of what was measured. For table structure, I like the main data sheet to contain one row of column names, and then data, with any ancillary information in a metadata sheet. I think having lots of headers at the top, especially with merged cells (which I have seen in more than one database) is a headache for me to read in. If data providers are savvy and can use attributes like with netcdf files, that would be fine, especially for global maps. But for other kinds of measurements, an excel or csv file is great as long as it's in long format with only one row of column names before the data.","Sure. I haven't produced my own data for a long time, but I would be happy with those measurements to go into a data product, because I would like them to be useful to a wider range of people.","The time it takes to format and create metadata. Thankfully, I had some help uploading my data to a data archive (the Harvard Forest LTER curates a data archive, and they require everyone who works on their LTER to upload their data to it). At that time, early in my career, it was a substantial amount of work to get everything organized and metadata written. Now, I think I would have been more organized at the start. I think this is where having some kind of standard data format would be useful, as well as educating PhD students and early careers about best practices for managing data and metadata. I would have appreciated knowing more best practices early on!","I appreciate how important, confusing, and difficult to summarize the ""Notes"" section of an experimenters data sheet it. That is, the huge column to the side of your data sheet where you write all the random stuff that may or may not be important (e.g., ""spider found in chamber"", ""lots of condensation"", ""battery went dead right after reading"", ""strong wind during reading""). All that stuff that would not get compiled into a database and cannot be condensed into a column (perhaps you could have a Y/N for the presence of a note, so that we know something may have been up with this measurement). In general, I think the benefit of databases is that if you have enough measurements, the messiness inherent in data collection is averaged out, but it's worth noting on both sides that field conditions can be very messy.","I think my answer is the same as on the previous page. I definitely used to do all of the things that I gripe about in the data user answers, but now that I've seen both sides, I think it helps both data providers and users to keep a clean, machine-readable format, since data providers usually also need to analyse their data."

Our template changed quite often and then one as to go back to all the previous templates to change them accordingly. So, a lot of critical thinking should be done at the beginning to create a good template in order not to change it that often while entering data.
We were able to motivate a lot of people to help building the database. Yet, it takes also a lot of time to keep track of everything that is going on. So, a good system on keeping track of who is entering when a study and if and when they managed to finish it and if they did not finish it if somebody else can help with it. Especially when a lot of data get's entered at the same time it get be hard to keep track of everything.

Hackathons were always really helpful to motivate people to work on the database (either coding or data entering) and to get a lot of things done in a short amount of time.","In general, it helps a lot to have controlled vocabulary to make sure that everything is entered in the same way.

The headers should be self-explanatory as much as possible and as distinctive as possible in comparison to the other headers. People easily missunderstand headers and enter data at the wrong place.

This meant we essentially had to revisit the original sources and start from scratch (although the key benefit was that the sources had already been found).,"This is a big question! With both ISRaD and SIDb we relied on a template-based data entry process in order to smooth the data harmonization process. With SIDb, both the table structure and headers were originally more flexible, but we quickly realized that we could only allow flexibility with one or the other (i.e. structure or controlled vocabulary and rigid headers) or querying the database would be next to impossible. With ISRaD we went pretty far in the opposite direction, i.e. controlling both structure and headers and including a lot of controlled vocabulary. The downside of the ISRaD approach is that it was (and is) a lot of work to maintain.",Yes. Open data makes science better!,NA,"Of course adequate documentation of the methods and appropriate attribution of credit to authors is important, but methods documentation can be challenging. For example, ISRaD provides a space for defining bulk density methods, but it is hardly ever used, and that can lead to issues with comparing or averaging the wrong data. I think the keys for making peace with sharing data in a synthesis are: 1) fully transparent and reproducible data (where did the data come from, what changes were made), 2) credit to authors, 3) on the authors' end: providing adequate documentation of what you did!","There are key parameters for understanding soil data on broader scales that are unfortunately not provided in every source. These include geospatial coordinates (including elevation), climate data (MAT, MAP at minimum), vegetation data (forest, grassland, etc.), and soil taxonomy. Flexible units are also important, e.g. if you provide CO2 fluxes from an incubation, you should provide the data to express the fluxes relative to the amount of carbon in the soil sample or on a mass basis. Of course, every specific type of soil data has special considerations, but the basics (above) should be expected to be provided in every study (note to all of us when reviewing manuscripts!)"
2020-07-22T11:04:02Z,I have compiled data products to determine the mean responses of soil organic matter pools to global change and to also determine what is driving variation in these responses. I've done this using meta-analysis.,I found data sources by searching Web of Science and the ProQuest Agricultural and Environmental Database. In addition I pulled climate data from the WorldClim database.,"The most difficult part of compiling the data product was trying to determine what authors meant when they reported data. The most common issues I had were (1) trying to determine how soils were fractionated, as we had strict definitions for the pools we were considering; (2) what units the soil carbon data was reported in (i.e. they would report g/kg but not whether that was gC/kg soil or gC/ kg fraction); and (3) unclear reporting on the number of replicates, which is needed information for meta-analytical statistics. On the plus side, the vast majority of authors responded to my questions in a timely fashion and there was a clear trend of newer papers providing more of the data in the paper or supplementary.","My system was to record all the data in its original units and then do a calculation step to transfer all data to the same units. I did this all by hand, so writing a script that could perform these functions for me would be quite helpful. The only hurdle here, though, would be the need of bulk density for many calculations. You could use a pedotranfer function but that could introduce some error. You could avoid this problem by working in concentrations but stock is often preferred to represent absolute amounts. If you are working on differences between treatments, as I was, this isn't a problem, as stock and concentration provide the same response ratio. It is quite difficult to standardize headers for soil fractions, in particular. My method was to initially record one mineral size fraction number (which may have included adding up a number of silt+clay fractions from an aggregate fractionation) and two particulate fraction numbers (usually a light and heavy fraction, which also may have been a sum of fractions in the paper), with their definitions (i.e. density > 1.8 g/cm3). However, the way the ISRAD database handles fractions may have been better - although with very complex fractionations with aggregate, size, and density fractionations, even that method would be difficult. It may be that combining some data in a standardized way before adding it to a database is the best option.",Definitely! Field scale data is key for understanding mechanistic processes but to make large scale decisions we need large scale data.,"I have not generated very much data yet, as I am a graduate student. But I imagine the main hurdles would be storing your data in a place and format that is easy to find and understand.","I wish fractionation schemes were better understood. Dispersed and undispersed soils are sometimes viewed equally, when they actually represent very different functional pools.","I imagine this would be a little effort as possible. However, if this process could be a bit more collaborative and folks were willing to add their data to a database in a standardized way, rather than  having the data compiler guess at the methods, I think that could streamline the process."
