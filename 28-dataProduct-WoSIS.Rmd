# WoSIS

## September 2020 interview

On ISRIC and WoSIS.

  1) What is the history of ISRIC and WoSIS as a database?
      - ISRIC (International Soil Reference and Information Center), presently known as ISRIC - World Soil Information.
          + ISRIC is an international soil center that was founded in 1966 following the UNESCO council.
              - This council showed the need for an organization that could give examples of typical soil profiles.
          + ISRIC started as an international soil museum, but eventually moved digital to databases.
          + Since 1989, ISRIC has been accredited as world data center for soils by the international science council.
          + It provides standardized data for soils of the world, both global and continental soils.
      - WoSIS (World Soil Information Service)
          + While ISRIC is the organization, WOSIS is the database.
          + Created around 5 or 6 years ago by compiling databases that ISRIC already had.
              - Many of the initial databases were data compilations so there were a lot of replicates that needed to be condensed.
      - Harmonized World Soil database is a different product from WoSIS, evolved from FAO-UNESCO Soil Map of the World.
          + Combines existing regional and national soil information.
          + FAO classification drove decision rules.
      - SoilGrids
          + Uses soil profile observations from WoSIS and a stack of environmental covariates to map the spatial distribution of soil properties.

  2) Describe your workflow for ingesting data sets? 
      - First, look for datasets that contain soil data or people contact us with datasets.
      - Next, get a license to use the data.
          + Finding people/organizations willing to share their data can be difficult.
      - After these steps, we already have data as it arrives to us and a license, so we then generate metadata.
          + We have a server.
          + The metadata follows the European standards.
              - Questions and parameters always the same no matter the standard.
      - In the past, we would process the datasets one by one.
          + Recently, we have run it in a bunch, processing 18 datasets last year and 30 this year.
      - Have a script (Python) that reads all the source formats.
      - Then separate the formats into different folders.
          + Turns sheets into tables.
              - Now we have 500 tables which are not really related but you can kind of see what matches up.
      - Another schema that consists of datasets, tables, and columns.
          + Start assigning the columns to our ontologies.
          + Results in a table that has a list of attributes and units and methods.
      - Another script puts everything together.
          + Matching the tables that have related variables.
          + Have two tables, one that describes the sites and one that describes the layer and descriptions.
      - In general, we expect the data to be a certain structure, but not all follow this structure so expert curated manual conversion is needed.

  3) What decisions did you make to arrive at this workflow?
      - There have been a number of versions of WOSIS.
          + As you progress you see some things work well and some donâ€™t so adjustments are made.
      - Inside ISRIC, they did not have one compiled database but there was a need for one that was flexible enough to incorporate all the datasets they had.
          + This is how WoSIS came about. Subsequently, data sets shared by the international community were added to WoSIS for standardization.
      - Another project started to make derived soil property maps (SoilGrids250m) for the world using digital soil mapping.
          + Found that they needed more data to do this, but there was already a huge (30) stack in pipeline.
          + Currently processing them in batches. Bottleneck remains sharing (CC BY) of soil profile data for future use by the international community.

  4) How would someone get a copy of the data in this study?
      - Go on data.isric.org to access the ISRIC Data Hub, search for 'WoSIS'.
          + Searchable according to keywords or types of databases.
          + Able to download data.
      - Have a central database that they work on (WoSIS) and then extract 'shared data' that has been standardized and validated.
      - Snapshots 2016 and 2019 are frozen from that time.
      - Allow other people to add metadata if they want to be included in the registry.
          + Contains a DOI for consistent citation purposes and metadata.
          + This data is static.
          + In a TSV format that can be downloaded as zip files.
      - WOSIS_latest contains the same variables as Snapshots.
          + Consists of the more recent standardized data from WoSIS.
          + It is a dynamic set due to correcting errors if the occur and adding in new data.

  5) What would you do differently if you had to start again? What would be the same?
      - Avoid data compilations.
          + It brings 'trouble' when one starts to compile compilations because it creates overlap and repeated data
              - It is difficult to find which data are repeated.
              - Becomes very cumbersome to clean it.
          + Instead of using compilations, use source data.
              - Conversely, if you are using a compilation, make sure to not also include a reference to the source data.
      - Do things in batches.
          + Might not have as much time to go through details, but the time saved is worth it.
      - Try to steer away from excel.
          + people put things with colors, get bad habits.
          + Does not work as well with huge databases where it is difficult to see everything on huge tables.
      - Don't worry about quantity, worry about quality of databases.
      - Stick with open standards and open formats.
          + Open standards help with giving the project a future.
          + Open formats make it more likely that people will use it.
          
          
## Data model

```{r}
WoSIS_table <- dataDescription.ls$structure %>%
  filter(grepl('WoSIS_2019', data_product)) %>%
  mutate(key = data_type == 'id') %>%
  mutate(ref = case_when(grepl('^profile_id$', data_column) ~ 'profiles',
                         grepl('^profile_layer_id$', data_column) ~ 'layers_physical',
                         TRUE ~ as.character(NA)),
         ref_col = case_when(grepl('^profile_id$', data_column) ~ 'profile_id',
                             grepl('^profile_layer_id$', data_column) ~ 'profile_layer_id',
                         TRUE ~ as.character(NA))) %>%
    mutate(ref = if_else(data_table == ref, as.character(NA), ref))%>%
   rename('table'='data_table',  'column'='data_column' )
